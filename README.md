# totoboto4-Module-SDK

This template is used for creating modules for the [totoboto4 Discord Bot](https://github.com/totobono4/totoboto4).  
You can clone `totoboto4` and add any modules anyone will create with this.

You need `node.js` to use this template, it includes `npm`, just download it from [there](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

First, to create a module, just create a repo generated from this template, you **must** run this command before doing anything else:  
`npm init`  
It will generate your project as a new npm package linked to your repo, this is important for including your module to the bot.

This project already working with a `ping` command, so at this step you can just try to implement your module directly and manage it to works before doing anything else.

After that, you can do anything you want with your project, and add the module to the totoboto4 bot.  
See how to add a module to the bot on the [totoboto4](https://github.com/totobono4/totoboto4) repo.
